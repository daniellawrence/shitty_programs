Shitty Programs
==================

A collection of shitty programs / scripts.

You can use this to stress out a system, or to check your CGroups limits are working.

cpu_warmer.py
---------------

This is a very tight loop that while load up a single CPU to 100%.


disk_spinner.py
------------------

This will cause _alot_ of disk reads.
Read from the device mounted as root, and write it out to /dev/null.


Thanks

Shout out to @squarel for his talk about CGroups, it inspired this set of shitty programs.
